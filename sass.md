SASS / SCSS
  - why: 
    + CSS itself is awesome, but when stylesheets are getting larger or more
    complex, it's harder to maintain. So, it needs some help from CSS preprocessor
  - what: 
    + stylesheet language that's compiled to CSS
    + allows user to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax
    + programming language alike
  - pros: 
    + keep stylesheet well-organized and easy to maintain
    + it's easier to share stylesheet across the project
  - syntax:
    + Sass: without brackets
    + SCSS: with brackets (the same as CSS)
