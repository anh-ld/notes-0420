JS design pattern
  - what:
    + reusable solution that can be applied to commonly recurring problems in
    software design
  - why:
    + proven solution
    + easily reused
    + avoid repetition in code
    + developer (mostly) knows
  - types:
    + creational: focus on object creation mechanism to increase the flexibility
    and reusability
    + structural: assemble object and class into large structure while keeping
    it flexible
    + behavioral: focus on the communication between object

Creational pattern
  - singleton: class has only 1 instance
  - prototype: creating new instance by cloning existing instance
  - factory: allow subclass to alter to type of instance will be created
  - builder: seperate the construction code and the representation code of class

Structural pattern
  - adapter: allow instances with different interfaces to collaborate

Behavioral pattern
  - observer: define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about 
  any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
